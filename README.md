I am a seasoned developer with over three decades of real-world experience in creating, programming, and delivering websites, software, and mobile applications for a diverse range of clients. My portfolio includes projects for commercial brands, non-profits, and corporations, showcasing my ability to adapt to various industries and client needs.

During my time at Dolby, I led a dynamic team in designing and releasing milestone versions of the RTS Unity Publisher and Player plugins. These releases elevated the plugins from basic streaming operations to a whole new level of capabilities, unlocking numerous exciting use cases. Additionally, I had the privilege of developing captivating demo experiences for Dolby.io's activations at events like SXSW, where I showcased technical and customer demos that left a lasting impression on developers.

As an advocate for developer relations, I firmly believe that building strong relationships with developers is the key to success. I strive to be an empathetic listener, amplifying their voices and advocating for their needs within the developer community. Through my practical developer experience, business partnership development, thought leadership, and content creation, I have consistently made a significant impact on the startups I collaborate with.

I have a passion for continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies, languages, frameworks, and design patterns. Sharing my knowledge with developers of all levels brings me joy, and I engage with the community through direct interaction, thought leadership, writing, and the creation of compelling content demos.
